# Assignment 5 - Memory Management

This project consists of writing a program that translates logical to physical
addresses for a virtual address space of size 2 16 = 65, 536 bytes. Your program
will read from a file containing logical addresses and, using a TLB as well as a
page table, will translate each logical address to its corresponding physical ad-
dress and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.
The goal behind this project is to simulate the steps involved in translating
logical to physical addresses.

## Specifics

Your program will read a file containing several 32-bit integer numbers that
represent logical addresses. However, you need only be concerned with 16-bit
addresses, so you must mask the rightmost 16 bits of each logical address. These
16 bits are divided into (i) an 8-bit page number and (ii) 8-bit page offset. Other
specifics include the following:

* 16 entries in the TLB
* 256 entries in the page table
* Page size of 256 bytes
* 256 frames in the physical memory
* Frame size of 256 bytes
* Physical memory of 65,536 bytes (256 frames Ã— 256-byte frame size)

## Address Translation

Your program will translate logical to physical addresses using a TLB and page
table. First, the page number is extracted from the logical address, and the
TLB is consulted. In the case of a TLB-hit, the frame number is obtained from
the TLB. In the case of a TLB-miss, the page table must be consulted. In the
latter case, either the frame number is obtained from the page table or a page
fault occurs.

## Handling Page Faults

Your program will implement demand paging. The backing store (e.g., your
disk) is represented by the file BACKING STORE.bin, a binary file of size 65,536
bytes. When a page fault occurs, you will read in a 256-byte page from the file
1BACKING STORE.bin and store it in an available page frame in physical memory.
For example, if a logical address with page number 15 resulted in a page fault,
your program would read in page 15 from BACKING STORE.bin (remember that
pages begin at 0 and are 256 bytes in size) and store it in a page frame in
physical memory. Once this frame is stored (and the page table and TLB are
updated), subsequent accesses to page 15 will be resolved by either the TLB or
the page table.  

You will need to treat BACKING STORE.bin as a random-access file so that
you can randomly seek to certain positions of the file for reading. We suggest
using the standard C library functions for performing I/O, including fopen(),
fread(), fseek(), and fclose(). The size of physical memory is the same as
the size of the virtual address space (65,536 bytes), so you do not need to be
concerned about page replacements during a page fault. Later, we describe a
modification to this project using a smaller amount of physical memory; at that
point, a page-replacement strategy will be required.

## Test File

We provide the file addresses.txt, which contains integer values representing
logical addresses ranging from 0 - 65,535 (the size of the virtual address space).
Your program will open this file, read each logical address and translate it to
its corresponding physical address, and output the value of the signed byte at
the physical address.

## How to Begin

First, write a simple program that extracts the page number and offset (an 8-bit
page number and 8-bit page offset) from the following integer numbers:
1, 256, 32768, 32769, 128, 65534, 33153
Perhaps the easiest way to do this is by using the operators for bit-masking and
bit-shifting. Once you can correctly establish the page number and offset from
an integer number, you are ready to begin. Initially, we suggest that you bypass
the TLB and use only a page table. You can integrate the TLB once your page
table is working properly. Remember, address translation can work without
a TLB; the TLB just makes it faster. When you are ready to implement the
TLB, recall that it has only 16 entries, so you will need to use a replacement
strategy when you update a full TLB. You can use FIFO for updating your TLB.

## How to Run Your Program

Your program should run as follows:

```
./a.out addresses.txt
```

Your program will read in the file addresses.txt, which contains 1,000 logical
addresses ranging from 0 to 65,535. Your program is to translate each logical
address to a physical address and determine the contents of the signed byte
stored at the correct physical address. Your program is to output the following
values:

1. The logical address being translated (the integer value being read from
2addresses.txt).
2. The corresponding physical address (what your program translates the
logical address to).
3. The signed byte value stored at the translated physical address.

We also provide the file correct.txt, which contains the correct output values
for the file addresses.txt. You should use this file to determine if your program is
correctly translating logical to physical addresses. Statistics After completion,
your program is to report the following statistics:

1. Page-fault rate: the percentage of address references that resulted in
page faults.
2. TLB hit rate: the percentage of address references that were resolved in
the TLB.

Since the logical addresses in addresses.txt were generated randomly and
do not reflect any memory access locality, do not expect to have a high TLB hit
rate.

## Modifications

This project assumes that physical memory is the same size as the virtual ad-
dress space. In practice, physical memory is typically much smaller than a
virtual address space. A suggested modification is to use a smaller physical
address space. We recommend using 128 page frames rather than 256. This
change will require modifying your program so that it keeps track of free page
frames as well as implementing a page-replacement policy using LRU.
