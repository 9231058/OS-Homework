# Assignment 3 - Threads and Mutexes

In this assignment you need to write a program that creates three threads.
These threads access a shared integer, called buffer, one at a time. The buffer
will initially be set to 0. Each thread should print its thread ID, process ID
and the bufferâ€™s current value in one statement, then increment the buffer by
one. Use a mutex to ensure this whole process is not interrupted. Have the
threads modify the buffer a total of 15 times. When each thread is done, it
should return the number of times it modified the buffer to the main thread.

```bash
$ ./assignment3
```
